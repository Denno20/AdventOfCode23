These are my solutions to the advent of code challenges

They are by no means the most efficient or elegant solution, because that's not what I'm aiming for with these challenges, and I don't have a great deal of time with other commitments at uni to make my solutions elegant. My approach is to use problem solving to break the challenges down into tasks and then to utilise code to implement my way of thinking. Feel free however to look at my solutions if you so desire :)
